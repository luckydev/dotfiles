HOW TO USE 

1. Clone this repo to your machine
2. Set up your ~/.bash_profile to read the bashrc inside the repo. Like,

```bash
vi ~/.bash_profile
```

Insert this line at the bottom:
```bash
source LOCATION_OF_CLONED_REPO/bashrc
```


Replace LOCATION_OF_CLONED_REPO by the actual location of cloned dotfiles, for me it is 
```bash
source ~/Dropbox/dotfiles/bashrc
```
