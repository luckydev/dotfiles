HOW TO USE 

1. Clone this repo to your machine
2. Set up your ~/.bash_profile to read the bashrc inside the repo. Like,

`vi ~/.bash_profile`

Insert this line at the bottom:

`source LOCATION_OF_CLONED_REPO/bashrc`


Replace LOCATION_OF_CLONED_REPO by the actual location of cloned dotfiles, for me it is 
`source ~/Dropbox/dotfiles/bashrc`
